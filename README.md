# Some `ncurses` Snakes!

**Developing a simple version of Snake in various programming languages!**

Each folder contains a version of the game Snake for terminal that interfaces with `ncurses` to provide the game UI, or some other library in case it's not available.

I thought of this idea to learn Go, but now I want to expand it a little, just to give it a touch of many different languages.

**Make sure to check the implementation-specific READMEs, not just this one!**

## Current Implementations

+ C
+ That's it for now :smile:

## C Version

Inside the `c/` folder. You can find a few `.c` and `.h` and build script for Snake. Just execute the script and run `snake` once complete!

Here is an Asciinema Demo of the C version:
