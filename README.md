# Some `ncurses` Snakes!

**Developing a simple version of Snake in various programming languages!**

Each folder contains a version of the game Snake for terminal that interfaces with `ncurses` to provide the game UI, or some other library in case it's not available.

I thought of this idea to learn Go, but now I want to expand it a little, just to give it a touch of many different languages.

## Current Implementations

+ C
+ That's it for now :smile:

## C Version

You can **check the specific `README.md`** inside the `c/` folder. You can find a few `.c` and `.h` and build script for Snake. Just execute the script and run `c/snake` once complete!
